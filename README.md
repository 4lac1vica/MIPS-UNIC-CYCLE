# MIPS Unic Cycle
Source Code for MIPS Unic Cycle. In this document I will explain how MIPS Unic Cycle works and how I implemented it (using Xilinx Vivado and VHDL).

First of all, we need to understand what MIPS stands for. MIPS stands for Microprocessor without Interlockeded Pipeline Stages. This means that there are no hardaware interlocks in the pipeline and the compiler handles hazard avoidance. This type of microprocessor consists of several subcomponents, each with its own specific functionality, which I will describe in the following section. 

1) MPG --> Monopulse Generator
   This module is responsible for conditioning the input signals generated by a mechanical push-button. Mechanical switches do not produce an ideal digital transition; instead, they can
   introduce signal oscillations and rapid, uninteded transitions between logic levels during actuation.
   By integrating this component, the switch debounce effect is eliminated, ensuring that each physical button press generates exactly one clean enable pulse. This guarantees reliable and deterministic control signals within the digital system.
   Now I will describe how i implemented it:
   

2) Instruction Fetch 


3) Decoder


4) Write Back Unit

5) Branch Unit

6) Jump Unit
 
7) Execution Unit
  
8) Control Unit
   
9) Memory
